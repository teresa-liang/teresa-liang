**ðŸ‘‹Hello! I'm Teresa, a 1st-year CS Student @ UC Irvine.**

I'm interested in exploring both the front & back-end development so that I can create products
that will make things easier and simpler for everyone! I'm always looking for more opportunities
to utilize my problem solving skills and attention to detail to further develop my skills in the computer science field.
Another area I am interested in is world of data science and machine learning!
